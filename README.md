# hello-world
Hi people who are taking time to read this. 

My name is Carlie, I'm a bisexual female and I enjoy music to it's fullest extent.  
My mom and grandma and girlfriend mean the absolute world to me. My favorite food would be fruit snacks. 
I have three dogs and a rabbit.  I absolutely hate gym and people who degrade others verbally. 
Yeah, that is me in a paragraph.
